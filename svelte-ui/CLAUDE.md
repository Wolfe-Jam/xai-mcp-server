## 🔧 Dev Server Issues (Common Problems)

### Problem 1: Server Crashes (Exit Code 137)
**Symptom:** `localhost refused to connect` or dev server stops responding

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart dev server
cd /Users/wolfejam/FAF/faf-one-svelte-new && npm run dev
```

**Background Command:**
If running in background, kill old process first, then restart with `run_in_background: true`

### Problem 2: JSON Code Blocks Cause Syntax Errors
**Symptom:** `[plugin:vite-plugin-svelte] Expected token }` when adding JSON examples

**Wrong:**
```svelte
<code>{
  "key": "value"
}</code>
```

**Correct:**
```svelte
<code>{`{
  "key": "value"
}`}</code>
```

**Rule:** Always wrap JSON code blocks with template literals `{``}` in Svelte files

### Problem 3: Hot Reload Fails
**Symptom:** Changes don't appear after saving files

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on macOS)
2. If that fails, restart dev server
3. Clear Vite cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`

### Dev Server Best Practices
- Run dev server in background for long sessions
- Watch for exit code 137 (out of memory)
- Always escape curly braces in code examples
- Test new blog posts in browser before committing

## 🏁 GOLDEN RULES - Professional Standards

### 🚨 NPM PUBLISH PROTOCOL - DOES NOT APPLY

**This is a SvelteKit website, NOT an npm package.**
- No npm publish workflow
- Changes deploy via git push
- Professional git commits still required (see below)

**For FAF package publishes** (faf-cli, claude-faf-mcp, faf-mcp):
- See `/Users/wolfejam/FAF-GOLD/PLANET-FAF/PUBLISH-PROTOCOL.md`
- Never publish without "GO!" or "GREEN LIGHT" from wolfejam

### Git Commit Protocol (REQUIRED)
**Every commit must follow this exact format:**
```
<type>: <what changed>

- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
```

**Types:** `fix:` `feat:` `docs:` `refactor:` `chore:` `test:`

**Examples:**
- `fix: Update PR reference to #2759`
- `feat: Add discussions link to navigation`
- `docs: Correct download statistics`

**NEVER:**
- No exclamation marks
- No emotion or excitement
- No marketing language
- No "finally" or "at last"
- No false claims about approval

### NPM Publish Protocol (APPROVAL REQUIRED)
**Before ANY npm publish:**
1. Get explicit approval from wolfejam
2. Verify all claims are factual
3. Update version following semver
4. Test in isolation first
5. Use boring release notes

**Release note format:**
```
v1.2.3

- Fix: Corrected dependency issue
- Feat: Added new command option
- Docs: Updated installation guide
```

### The Professional Standard
- **Boring is good**
- **Facts only**
- **Trust is everything**
- **If Anthropic reads it, would they approve?**
- **When in doubt, make it more boring**

### Critical: Publishing & Committing
- **Git commits**: Follow protocol or don't commit
- **NPM publishes**: Require explicit approval
- **False claims**: Could kill PR #2759
- **Trust violations**: Unforgivable

Remember: We're playing at the level where Anthropic might actually merge our PR. Act like it.
